~9.Answer: c
Explanation:If any operand is double the result of expression is double.
~10.Answer:a
Explanation:None.
~11.Answer:b
Explanation:Type casting a larger variable into a smaller variable results in modulo of larger variable by range of smaller variable. b contains 300 which is larger than byte’s range i:e -128 to 127 hence d contains 300 modulo 256 i:e 44.

~18.Answer:c
Explanation: Parentheses do not degrade the performance of the program. Adding parentheses to reduce ambiguity does not negatively affect your system.
~19.Answer:b
Explanation: None.
~20.Answer:d
Explanation: Operator | returns true if any one operand is true, thus ‘c = true | false’ is true. Operator & returns a true if both of the operand is true thus d is false. Ternary operator ?: assigns left of ‘:’ if condition is true and right hand of ‘:’ if condition is false. d is false thus e = d ? b : c , assigns c to e , e contains true.
output:
  javac bool_operator.java
  java bool_operator
false true
